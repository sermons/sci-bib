</div>

>>>
The phrase "each according to its kind" (10x in Gen1, and also elsewhere) implies the existence of **boundaries** between kinds of life.

"Kind" is not necessarily "species" (the "Linnean lawn"), but there would be divisions, say, between fish vs frogs, or reptiles vs birds, and certainly apes vs humans. The idea is a forest of trees, with variation within a kind (e.g., tall dogs, short dogs, wolves, etc) but not crossing over into another kind (e.g., sheep).

Which model fits better with what we see in the world? Not scientists' opinions, but what we see.

- Miller's experiment: ammonia + reducing atmosphere + spark: produced amino acids
- Chirality: property of molecules. Proteins in life only use left-handed amino acids. DNA uses only right-handed nucleotides (essential for double-helix)!
- Any experiment only reinforces the need for a designer: the experimenter put intelligence into selecting for a desired result.
- Similarly with "genetic algorithm" computer simulations: the intelligence is all in the goal function
- origin of life is still problematic for evolutionists today! Seeded by comets / meteors? Aliens?

+ How much **longer** will our world last?

&rArr; **science** is not independent of **morality**!

>>>
- These scientific questions are not merely academic curiosities.
- If there really is a Creator, then He defines what is right and wrong,
what is sin and what is justice.
- In addition, the Bible's timeline for the universe is very short:
creation was a few thousand years ago, and also the judgment is coming
very soon, not in a billion years.

However, this world is getting just as wicked, if not more so, as
the world of Noah's time.  And God has a coming judgment, this time
by fire.

God provided an Ark to save all who would enter, and Noah
was surely telling all his friends and family of the coming judgment
and inviting them into the Ark to be saved.

In the same way, the only salvation from the coming judgment is through
Jesus Christ -- and we must, like Noah, spread the word with urgency.
